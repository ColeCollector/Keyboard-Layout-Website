# A keyboard layout analyzer and generator. 

Used to see diferent metrics relating to how comfortable/fast a keyboard layout is. For example SFB stands for same finger bigram and happens when two keys are typed one after the other and both in the same row. Layouts are generated by maximizing these metrics through simulating typing a set of words which are compacteded into the corpus folder. 

I made a website for this project which analyzes all of the layouts i could get my hands on from a keyboard layout discord server. It allows you to zoom, customize corpus, x and y axis. It also provides a definition for all of these different metrics.
